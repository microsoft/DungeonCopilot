# Dungeon & Copilot

Dungeon & Copilot is a gamified workshop designed to let users experience Copilot’s features in an easy and fun way. 

Initially, it was planned as an offline hands-on workshop, but as the version evolved, it has developed into a web-based online campaign that users can enjoy on their own. 

The development of this project follows several principles:

- It should be designed so users can enjoy it easily and have fun.
- It must be adaptable to specific customer events with minimal modifications.
- It should be built as a static HTML-based website without complex server modules.
- Although the content is currently planned in Korean, it should be easily portable to other languages.
